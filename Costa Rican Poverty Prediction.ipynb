    "The issue of poverty is an issue in even the wealthiest of countries such as the United States.  While countries have their own way of providing support to individuals in need, the issue of identifying people with the most needs is always an issue.  Many social programs have a hard time making sure the right people are given enough aid. It is especially difficult when a program focuses on the poorest segment of the population as they are unable to provide the income and expense records that are typically required for qualification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Latin America, a common method of verifying income qualification when income data is unavailable or unreliable is the Proxy Means Test (PMT).  With PMT, agencies use a model that considers a family’s observable household attributes like the material of their walls and ceiling, or the assets found in the home to classify them and predict their level of need.  While this test is better at evaluating income needs over other methods, the accuracy of predicting income qualification remains a problem as the region’s population grows and poverty declines.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this backdrop, our team has selected a data set called the “Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction” from Kaggle.  The data set has been provided by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), which is the largest source of development financing for Latin American and Caribbean countries.  The goal of the IDB in providing this data set is to get support in improving income qualification for some of the world's poorest families for social welfare assistance in Latin America. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction).  It is also their belief that new methods, beyond traditional econometrics, might be identified that could improve PMT performance.\n",
    "The dataset is a file with household characteristics from a sample of Costa Rican households from an unknown year. The dataset has observations for each member of the household, but the classification is done at the household level. The target is an ordinal variable indicating groups of income levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\t1 = extreme poverty\n",
    "•\t2 = moderate poverty\n",
    "•\t3 = vulnerable households\n",
    "•\t4 = non-vulnerable households\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to use the household characteristics provided and possibly create new features to predict the income levels using classification. Since the test set does not have the target variable, we will test the accuracy by submitting our predicted results to Kaggle.\n",
