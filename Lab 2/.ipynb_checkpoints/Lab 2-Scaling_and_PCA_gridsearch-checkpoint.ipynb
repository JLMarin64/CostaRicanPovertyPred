    "From previous exploratory analysis in the confusion matrix, the models have trouble predicting the poverty levels 1 (extreme), 2 (moderate), and 3 (vulnerable). However, there is a high amount of predictability in poverty level 4 (non-vulnerable). This could indicate that there is some skewness in the data making it difficult to get higher accuracy in the other levels. Also when looking at one vs. one comparison in SVM, there are some erroneous relationships especially when comparing poverty level 3 vs. 4 and povery level 1 vs. 2. This could indicate that the these two groups maybe similar in nature or there is an oversampling of the higher poverty levels making it difficult to differentiate at that level of granularity. When looking at the frequency we can clearly see that poverty level 4 accounts for majority of the data set. Therefore, it maybe needed to collapse certain levels to help increase the predictability of other levels. Therefore, collapsing poverty level 1, 2, and 3 could help balance the dataset and increase the size of the lower levels.\n",

    "However, in order to keep the number of classes that we have in the dataset and follow the goal of the kaggle dataset. The final decision is to not collapse the class variables, but use different options in the models to allow for different weights on the class. This is done in order to not give equal weight to all variables and not be skewed because of the abundance of one variable"

    "In the previous analysis done with logistic regression and SVM, some variables were dropped because it did not increase the accuracy and confusion matrix accuracy criteria in the previous analysis. Therefore, a manual iterative drop of variables were done to see if this would increase or decrease the fit statistic. When looking at importance features once scaled in Linear SVM and Logistic Regression, we can see that a lot of the variables that comes up as important are the amount of education, household size, and number of dependents. The many features that did not come up as important are luxury items such computers and tablets, wall materials, structure of the house in terms of bathroom and flooring, and gender. Therefore, based on logic and intutition some variables were dropped according to this understanding "
