    "In the Scikit learn logistic regression, the default setting is one vs. all methdology for a multi-class dependent variable. In our case, we have 4 different classes 1,2,3,and 4 where 1 is extreme poverty and 4 non-vulnerable households. Some variables are dropped from the model because of redundancy and/or contribution to the total variation is small. After adjusting for the variation in each of the explanatory variables, importance can now be interpreted. This is because of the large amount of variables being used so we are only looking at the top 3 negatively and positively correlated features. \n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the first model, extreme poverty vs. all, we can see that overcrowding square, qmobilephone, and mean education are high importance on the negative end. On the positive end, people with education less than 15 years, public electricity, and overcrowding are high importance.In the case of extreme poverty, overcrowding and education seem to be overarching theme of extreme poverty. Increase in mean education and number of mobile phones indicates a lower likelihood of not being in poverty, where we can say number of mobile phones is proxy for income of the household. Increase in the number of people with less than 15 years of education, use of public electricity, and overcrowding indicates a higher likelihood of being in extreme poverty, where public electricity could be a proxy for income of the household also.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the second model, moderate poverty vs. all, we can see that on the negative end number of adults in the household, education of the male head of household squared, and number of post-graduates or higher are of high importance. This seems to be indicate that higher number of adults, education of the male of household squares, and post graduate degrees decreases the likelihood of being in moderate poverty. On the postive end, we can see people with education less than 15 years, education of the male head of household, and overcrowding square are of high importance. We see the same variable overcrowding and people with education less than 15 years, that increases in these variable will increase the likehood of being in moderate poverty. The square of overcrowding could indicate a quadratic relationship indicating a minimum of overcrowding can increase the liklihood of moderate poverty.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the third model,vulnerable household vs. all, number of children between 0 to 19 squared, number of adults in the household, and post graduate degrees are of high importance on the negative end. The reoccurring theme of higher education lowers the likelihood of being in a vulnerable household is present. It seems to also shows that there could be a maximum of number of children which could decrease the likelihood of being in a vulnerable household. Also having more adults in the household decreases the likelihood of being in vulnerable household since this could be a proxy for more income. On the positive end, people with education less than 15 years, use of electricity from cooperative, and use of public electricity are of high importance. It seems to show that having less than 15 years of education significantly increases your likelihood of being in a vulnerable household. Also what kind of electricity you can afford, public and cooperative, is a proxy of income and so using these types of electricity means lower income which mean higher likelihood of being in a vulnerable household.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the fourth model, non-vulnerable households vs all, we can see that people with education less than 15 years, use of electricity from cooperative, and use of public electricity are of high importance. This is the exact oppositive of the vulnerable household. If the household has any of these indicators then they have a lower likelihood of being a non-vulnerable household. On the positive end, number of adults in the household, number of postgraudate degrees, and number of individuals in the household indicate a higher likelihood of being in a non-vulnerable household. This is intuitive because the more adults could mean more income, having a postgraduate degree means a higher paying job, and more individuals in the household means the household is able to afford the high cost that comes with large households.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some variables are more important than others because of how prevalent the characteristic is for the given level. We can see that overcrowding is prevelant in the extreme and moderate poverty levels but not in the vulnerable and non-vulnerable levels. This indicates there are more people with type of characteristic at those poverty levels. However, there is an overarching theme that education is good indicator for poverty levels. In that each poverty level has some type of education variable. This seems to show that there is a certain threshold of education that can determine what is the likelihood of a given poverty level. "

    "When using linear for SVM on our dataset, it takes high computational power and time to obtain an answer. In our case, we waited for a long time and results cannot be obtained for the support vectors when using all variables in the estimation. Because of this, RBF kernel is used and classification can be applied to the dataset, which gives the accuracy and the confusion matrix. Since the RBF kernel is used the support vectors cannot be estimated because it goes to higher dimensions which is mathmatically not possible to estimate. Therefore, no estimations on weight and no insight cannot be gained into the data.   "
